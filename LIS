Longest Consecutive Sequence
Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.

A consecutive sequence is a sequence of elements in which each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element. The elements do not have to be consecutive in the original array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time

class Solution:
    def longestConsecutive(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        mp = defaultdict(int)
        res = 0

        for num in nums:
            if not mp[num]:
                mp[num] = mp[num - 1] + mp[num + 1] + 1
                mp[num - mp[num - 1]] = mp[num]
                mp[num + mp[num + 1]] = mp[num]
                res = max(res, mp[num])
        return res
